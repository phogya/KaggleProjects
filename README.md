# KaggleProjects
A collection of my Kaggle competition projects. Includes two attempts at the beginner housing regression competition with two different approaches attempting to classify numeric and categoric data for regression. Also includes one attempt at a plant pathology competition using convolutional neural networks for multiclass image classification.
